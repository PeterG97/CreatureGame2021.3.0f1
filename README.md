# CreatureGame2021.3.0f1
 
Description:
Made entirely by me, Peter Giblin. Written in C# 9.0 using Unity 2021.3.0f1.
This game is more of a simulation project in which slime-like animals and an assortment of plants randomly populate a dynamically generated space.
Both the plants and animals (mainly the animals) have a wide assortment of traits that influence their survival.
These lifeforms reproduce and pass on their traits with a small amount of variation each generation.
The goal of this project is to make an environment in which populations develop interesting and unique sets of traits each time the game is run.
